  - publish next release?

Next milestone release:
  - show player names when possible
  - clearer turn notification:
     - on gameslist, games where it is my turn should be sorted to top
     - in game, the controlling player should be more visible
     - make sound / update title bar when it is your turn

Next milestone release:
  - chat support / revise transcript format to allow commentary?
  - prettify frontpage

HTML:
  - make reset button go back only one (sub)phase/move
  - option to show field coordinates
  - add sound effects (especially to notify player of his turn)
  - should highlight "my" player more clearly

Rules:
  - Explain how to play online (see TODO in rules.html);
    maybe create a separate page?
  - Show an example game from start to finish.
    I already have a sample game in rules.html; just need to create a widget
    that allows stepping through it move by move.

Setup mode:
  - should have a "back" button 
  - support single-player mode
  - add copy-to-clipboard icon to player links
    (for n00bs that don't know how to right-click Copy Link Address)
