Milestone release:
  - show game list on index page (with a link to board setup)
  - provide separate player URLs
  - allow player to specify their names
  - show player scores
  - server should store game state, not just objectified version.
    Proposal:
        {
            id:    [[game id]]
            state: [[GameState instance]],
            keys:  [[player keys]]
        }

  - chat support / revise transcript format to allow commentary?
  - server should skip players with no moves
    (careful: if nobody can move, the game is over!)

To deploy on Heroku:
  - implement PostgreSQL storage backend

HTML:
  - make reset button go back only one (sub)phase or move
  - server should validate turns! (and moveselections?)
  - option to show field coordinates

Server:
  (Nothing else for now.)

Setup mode:
  - should have a "back" button!
