 !! game owner should have option to retrieve player keys after game creation!

Next milestone release:
  - provide separate player URLs
  - associate games with accounts
  - show player names when possible
  - clearer turn notification
  - chat support / revise transcript format to allow commentary?
  - prettify frontpage

Server:
 - sort/limit list of games (sort by online count first, mtime second?)
   (move code from client to server)

HTML:
  - make reset button go back only one (sub)phase or move
  - option to show field coordinates
  - separate board setup from rest of client (too much tight coupling!)
  - add sound effects (especially to notify player of his turn)

Setup mode:
  - should have a "back" button!
  - support single-player mode

==> accounts:

If a player opens a game URL while logged in, the game should be associated
with his account so that he can find it again.  (Either game key if he creates
the game, or player key if he's just a player.)
