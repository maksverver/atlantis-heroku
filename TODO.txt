  - chat?
  - revise transcript format to allow commentary?
  - make code formatting/identifier naming consistent across sources
  - separate player URLs!

HTML:
  - make reset button go back only one (sub)phase or move
  - server should validate turns! (and moveselections?)
  - separate player urls
  - server should calculate stable regions & skip players without turns
    (careful: if nobody can move, the game is over!)
  - option to show field coordinates
  - maybe later: textures for the colorblind?

Server:
  - Document client/server interface.
    (Maybe rename some messages to be clearer.)
  - server should store game state, not just objectified version.
    Proposal:
        {
            id:    [[game id]]
            state: [[GameState instance]],
            keys:  [[player keys]]
        }

Setup:
  - should have a "back" button!

Deploy on heroku/flatpc?
