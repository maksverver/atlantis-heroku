Milestone release:
  - server storage should track modification time
  - server should list unconnected games too (by decreasing mtime?)
  - server should store game state, not just objectified version.
    Proposal:
        {
            id:    [[game id]]
            state: [[GameState instance]],
            keys:  [[player keys]],
            time-begun,
            time-ended,
            finished: true/false
        }
    (Document this somewhere!)
  - server should skip players with no moves
    (and end the game when nobody can move)
    (needs a protocol update to skip multiple moves?)

Milestone release:
  - provide separate player URLs
  - allow player to specify their names
  - chat support / revise transcript format to allow commentary?
  - prettify frontpage

To deploy on Heroku:
  - implement PostgreSQL storage backend (with modification time)

Board canvas:
  - option to show field coordinates

HTML:
  - make reset button go back only one (sub)phase or move
  - option to show field coordinates
  - separate board setup from rest of client (too much tight coupling!)
  - add sound effects (especially to notify player of his turn)

Setup mode:
  - should have a "back" button!
  - support single-player mode
